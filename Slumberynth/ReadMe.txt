Slumberynth is a 3D puzzle game set within a labyrinth (duh), where the maze itself is the challenge. Navigate through roaming obstacles, and piece together clues hidden in every corner. Find the exit—if you’re clever enough—and claim your freedom at the end of the run. https://ridhoyulian70.itch.io/slumberynth
